Hi, all!

&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in the theory and the application in felds of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligent, Computer Vision, Computer Graphic, Motion Control and Robotics, which in particular the areas of Legged Robots, Wheeled Robots, Robot Hands and so on. Currently, I am solving a number of intelligent control problems by using deep reinforcement learning.
&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, I am also a departmenter manager at a technology company, and accumulated a wealth of experience in Motion Control, Embedded Systems, Electronic Ｄesign, Project Management and etc. In 2013, I recognized that merely engineering would not satisfy the leading technology pursuing so that i found the Easybot Team with [Xiang Chen](http://simonchanper.github.io), [Jianhan Mei](http://meijianhan.github.io/JHMei/),[Qingyun He](http://janhocn.github.io) and [Qingwei Liu](http://www.liuqingwei.com) for developing and researching advanced techniques.
